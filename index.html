                <p>
                  Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) refers to differences that
                  affect a person’s learning, reasoning, and everyday life skills from an early
                  age. People with IDD are lifelong learners who benefit from supportive
                  environments that build on their strengths.

                <p>
                  Many learners with IDD thrive with predictable routines, clear instructions,
                  and patient guidance. They may experience challenges in communication or
                  problem-solving, but they also bring creativity, loyalty, and unique
                  perspectives to the classroom.

                  and designing lessons that welcome all learners.
